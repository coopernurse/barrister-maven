## Overview

The `barrister-maven-plugin` allows you to convert Barrister RPC IDL files to .java files with
a minimum amount of configuration.

Add to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
  <build>
      <plugins>
          <plugin>
              <!-- These three properties are boilerplate -->
              <groupId>com.bitmechanic</groupId>
              <artifactId>barrister-maven-plugin</artifactId>
              <version>0.1.17</version>

              <!-- Your configuration options here -->
              <configuration>
                  <!-- uncomment below to use the command line barrister translator -->
                  <!--<barristerScript>/usr/bin/barrister</barristerScript>-->

                  <!-- this uses the hosted translator -->
                  <barristerScript>http://barrister.bitmechanic.com/run</barristerScript>

                  <idlFiles>src/main/resources/idl</idlFiles>
                  <exclude>conform-inc.idl</exclude>
                  <basePackage>com.bitmechanic.test</basePackage>
                  <outputDirectory>src/main/java</outputDirectory>
                  <immutable>true</immutable>
                  <clean>true</clean>
              </configuration>

              <!-- More boilerplate -->
              <executions>
                  <execution>
                      <phase>generate-sources</phase>
                      <goals>
                          <goal>idl2java</goal>
                      </goals>
                  </execution>
              </executions>
          </plugin>
      </plugins>
  </build>
```

## Configuration Reference

The following config options are available:

Element             | Default                        | Notes
--------------------|--------------------------------|------
`<barristerScript>` | barrister                      | Either a path to the Python Barrister translation script, or the URL to the hosted service
`<idlFiles>`        | src/main/resources/barrister   | Comma separated paths to IDL files. Directories will have all *.idl files included.
`<exclude>`         | (none)                         | Comma separated file names to exclude from translation. Wild cards are not currently supported.
`<basePackage>`     | $groupId.$artifactId.generated | Base Java package for generated .java files - each IDL file will be a sub-package from this root
`<outputDirectory>` | src/main/java                  | Base output directory to generate source code to into
`<immutable>`       | <empty>                        | If "true", all generated Java struct classes will be immutable (no setters, arrays are cloned on read). If not true, value is considered to be a comma separated list of package substrings to make immutable.
`<clean>`           | false                          | If true, the outputDirectory+basePackage will be recursively deleted before translation to remove artifacts from previous invocation

Once you have your project configured, I highly recommend adding `<clean>true</clean>` to ensure you don't have orphaned
.java files from previous runs on disk.  It is disabled by default simply to prevent you from accidentally wiping out your
source tree.

## FAQ

*What's this `<barristerScript>` business?  Do I need Python to run this?*

Barrister IDL specifies a grammar for defining data structures and interfaces.  The `.idl` text files
are translated to a JSON representation that all the various language bindings understand.

The IDL translator is written in Python, and is available at
[coopernurse/barrister](https://github.com/coopernurse/barrister)

It is recommended that you install the command line translator, but if you don't want to then you can
use the hosted translator by setting:

`<barristerScript>http://barrister.bitmechanic.com/run</barristerScript>`

Note: I provide no uptime guarantees for the hosted translator.  So please don't rely on it for any
critical build processes.  But it's quite useful when you're trying Barrister out for the first time.
